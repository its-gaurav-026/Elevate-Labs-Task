# 🌐 Task 7 – Fetch and Display User Data

This project was built as part of a Web Development Internship task.

## 📋 What I Did

- Created a  webpage using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.
- Used the **Fetch API** to get user data from a public API:  
  `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users`
- Displayed each user’s **name, email, and address** in styled cards.
- Handled errors using `try...catch` and showed a friendly message if the fetch fails.
- Added a **reload button** to refetch the data.
- Tested network error handling by turning off internet and verifying UI response.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Make sure you're connected to the internet to load data.
3. Click the **Reload Users** button anytime to fetch again.
4. Disable internet and reload to see error handling in action.
