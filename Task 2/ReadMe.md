# 📝 Modern To-Do List Web App

This is a responsive To-Do List application built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

## ✅ Features
- Add new tasks with an input and button
- Mark tasks as completed by clicking on them
- Delete tasks with a ❌ icon
- Move completed tasks to a separate section
- Responsive layout for desktop, tablet, and mobile

## 💡 How It Works
- Tasks are added dynamically using JavaScript.
- Various icons (like ❌ for delete, ✅ for completed, 📋 for header, and others) are added using **Unicode emoji characters** via `innerHTML` or directly in HTML.
- Clicking a task toggles its completion state.
- Tasks can be deleted without reloading the page.
